# Fine-tune Chatbot with Node.js

This project involves the creation of a chatbot that can answer questions based on specific data such as support tickets or any other user-defined data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- OpenAI account and API key
- Python3 installed locally
- OpenAI and pandas Python libraries installed

## Setup

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

npm install

### Step 2: Obtain OpenAI Key

Create your OpenAI API key  https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  and store it in a .env file in the root directory of your project:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key

Replace your_api_key with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Step 3: Prepare your data

You'll need to collect and prepare data based on your requirements. OpenAI recommends having at least hundreds of data samples.

Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install openai pandas

Then, prepare your data using the OpenAI fine-tune tool in your commandline:


openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f your_Data.csv

### Step 4: Train your model

Train your data using the OpenAI API:

openai api fine_tunes.create -t databefore_prepared.jsonl -m davinci --n_epochs 16

You can adjust the number of epochs as needed, but keep in mind that training for more epochs will take more time and may incur more cost.

### Step 5: Use your fine-tuned model

Find your fine-tuned model on the OpenAI Playground under the 'fine-tuning' section (https://platform.openai.com/playground).
Copy the model identifier and use it in your server.js file:

model: 'your_openai_model',


Replace your_openai_model with your actual OpenAI model.

That's it! You now have a chatbot that can answer questions based on your data. If the chatbot doesn't know the answer, it will respond with "I don't know". Remember, the chatbot's responses will only be as good as the data you've trained it with.
